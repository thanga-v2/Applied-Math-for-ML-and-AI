Linear Algebra - The Theory of Everything (Vectors, Matrix, Line, Areas and Space).

2x + 3y = 5
1x + 1y = 2

Above is a system. 2 equeations, 2 Var

what is a solutions of a system?
A solutions of a system of linear equation is set of points, that makes every equation in the system true. eg : (x,y) = (1,1)

A system of Linear Equaytions have either 
1 solution, 
0 solution or 
Infinitely many solutions. (these are the only three possibilities)

A linear system is consistent if it has 1 or Infinitely many solutions.
else it is Inconsistent.

Then how can we find a solution?

Thats where Matrix comes into picture.


Row reduction and echelon form ref(A) : 

row Echelon form : 

1.All non zero rows are above zero rows
2.Each leadin entry of a row is in a column to the right of the leading entry of a row
3.all entries in a column below a leading entry are zero

reduced row echeclon form rref (A) : 

1.leading entry in each row should be 1
2.each leading 1 is the only non zero enrty in column
