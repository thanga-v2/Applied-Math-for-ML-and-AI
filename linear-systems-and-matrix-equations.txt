Linear Algebra - The Theory of Everything (Vectors, Matrix, Line, Areas and Space).

2x + 3y = 5
1x + 1y = 2

Above is a system. 2 equeations, 2 Var

what is a solutions of a system?
A solutions of a system of linear equation is set of points, that makes every equation in the system true. eg : (x,y) = (1,1)

A system of Linear Equaytions have either 
1 solution, 
0 solution or 
Infinitely many solutions. (these are the only three possibilities)

A linear system is consistent if it has 1 or Infinitely many solutions.
else it is Inconsistent.

Then how can we find a solution?

Thats where Matrix comes into picture.
